The exponential advancement of technology has led to a surge in the adoption and utilization of CNC machines 
across various industries. The production of inexpensive CNC machines is utilized to decrease the price and 
intricacy of the machines. The design of an automatic micro CNC machine for PCB drilling and drawing is the 
subject of this paper. Our project's concept is to design and drill PCBs using a low-cost CNC system; this 
is accomplished by integrating PC features with an Arduino-based ATMEGA 328 controller. We have implemented 
a G code for the entire system. G code is merely a language used to instruct computerized machine tools on 
"how to manufacture something." The how is specified through directives regarding the direction and velocity
 of motion.
